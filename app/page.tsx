                Why dont start with the latest project? In Branchevent The webdevs and 
                the digital designers joined forces to develop an application for the big LIA 
                (internship) event hosted by Yrgo. Each group where
                to develop their own interpretation of Yrgos style, while still submit and operational 
                sign up application. We developed an matching app where the students could match 
                with the companies attending to find the companies that liked the same techstachs 
                as the students. Its built in react for the frontend and we built an node express 
                rest api for the backend

                Protech was a joint effort project in wich we, the web devs, 
                joined forces with the Digital Design and Graphical Artist students to create a landing 
                page for a fictive product. the GA-students created the products, the designers designed 
                the layout, and we the web devs made it a reality! Since this was early on the stach 
                only contain html, css and vanilla JS. 
                
                Unfortunatly I dont have hosting for my php projects atm.

                Retronautica was a project in the course Digital Design where we was supposed to 
                create a website for our own dream cinema. Me and my project partner Liv both 
                love fantasy and science fiction, so ofcourse we made a science fiction cinema 
                who only plays old classics! It contains a landing page and a event page for 
                2000 A space odyseeÂ´. Again very early work and thus a lightweight stach of 
                html, css and JS

              <p>Yrgopelago was a project we had over christmas 2023. It was a contest among the students of the class, where we each made a fictive hotel in the  fictive archopelago of Yrgopelago. We then all got 100 dollars each wich we could then spend on eachothers hotels. The student who had the most money on the end of the day won! In this project I used php and sqlite to handle the backend while the frontend is basic html and css with a little JS sprinkled in</p>

              <p>If you get bored here, why dont head over to my first ever react application? Its currently hosted over at Vercel and is a very simple little tic tac toe game, where two players can play eachother. Its nothing fancy, nothing amazing, but still, creating a tic tac toe with React is for what i have heard a very common interview question for many tech companys. So here is mine!!!</p>
